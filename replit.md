# Genetic Circuit Designer

## Overview

The Genetic Circuit Designer is a sophisticated web-based platform for designing, simulating, and analyzing genetic circuits. It combines theoretical circuit modeling with physical hardware integration, featuring a drag-and-drop interface for circuit design, advanced parameter tuning, and EEPROM-based hardware control.
